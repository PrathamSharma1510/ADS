# README File

To execute the GatorLibrary Management System program with a custom input file, follow the command below in your terminal:

```shell
make run input_file=input.txt
```

Alternatively, you can use the standard method to run it:

```shell
python3 main.py <input.txt>
```

Make sure to replace `input.txt` with the name of your specific input file. The program will automatically generate the output file `output_file.txt` in the same directory.
